# Normalize an array of object (or collection) by a given key

The keyBy and collectionKeyBy functions can be useful in several scenarios where
you need to transform a collection of objects into an object for easier access
(With time complexity: **O(1)**) or manipulation.

1. **Data Normalization**: When you're working with a large dataset, it's often more
   efficient to store the data in a normalized form. For example, if you have an
   array of users, you might want to transform it into an object where the keys are
   user IDs and the values are the user objects. This allows you to quickly and
   easily look up a user by their ID.

2. **Data Indexing**: Similarly, if you're working with a collection of objects
   that have a unique identifier (like a database ID), you can use these
   functions to create an index of the objects by their identifier. This can
   significantly speed up operations like searching for an object by its
   identifier.

3. **Data Aggregation**: If you need to aggregate data based on a certain
   property, these functions can help. For example, if you have an array of
   transactions and you want to group them by user ID, you can use keyBy to
   create an object where the keys are user IDs and the values are arrays of
   transactions for each user.
