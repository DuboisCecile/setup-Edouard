# Workflow

1. **[Define Your Question](./01-definition.md)**: Before you start the analysis, you should know what
   you're looking for. This could be a specific question or a general idea of
   what you want to know.

2. **[Gather Your Data](./02-data-gathering.md)**: This could be collecting your own data or finding an
   existing dataset that fits your needs.

3. **[Clean Your Data](./03-data-cleaning.md)**: This involves handling missing or inconsistent data and may
   involve removing outliers.

4. **[Explore Your Data](./04-explore-data.md)**: This involves using statistical techniques to learn about the
   relationships between variables.

5. **[Analyze Your Data](./05-analys-data.md)**: Apply statistical or machine learning methods to answer your
   question.

6. **[Interpret Your Results](./06-interpretation.md)**: Make sure you understand what your analysis is telling
   you. This could involve statistical tests for significance, or it could be as
   simple as comparing the means of two groups.

## Example

```ts
// Load your data
const data = readFileSync('path_to_your_data.json', 'utf8')
const dataset = JSON.parse(data)
const column = 'name_of_the_column_to_analyse'

// Clean your data
const cleanedData = dataset.filter(item => item[column] !== null)

// Explore your data
const mean =
  cleanedData.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item[column], 0) / cleanedData.length

// Analyze your data
const variance =
  cleanedData.reduce((sum, item) => sum + Math.pow(item[column] - mean, 2), 0) /
  cleanedData.length

// Interpret your results
console.log(`Mean: ${mean}, Variance: ${variance}`)
```
